				<p class="devlogH">Devlog: 16/11/2021</p>
				<p class="devEntry">This the first entry in the devlog of Blitz3D Aquarium.<br>
				I'll be posting interesting stuff about the development of the "game" here, so check it out
				often if you're interested in what I add and the more technical details of the game.</p>
				<p class="devEntry">So the last time the game was updated it was still not that much different from how it started, visually, at least.<br>
				It still had the same old "stone" box around the playable area, still didn't have a proper player model, and well, it didn't really
				have that underwater felling that it should have.<br>
				That's fixed now! Check this out!</p>

				<img src="devlog\2.jpg" alt="Overview upside down with shark" class="16_9pic" style="width: 25.5315em; height: 14.2815em;">
				<img src="devlog\3.jpg" alt="Added fog too" class="16_9pic" style="width: 25.5315em; height: 14.2815em;">
				<p class="devEntry">As you can see, I got rid of the old gray box and added a seabed, with a lil sand texture (and an Easter Egg!! Try to find it.)<br>
				Also added some fog to get more of that underwater feeling. I'll probably be adding some randomly generated scenery soon (stuff like rocks and seaweed).<br><br>
				And this is the model used for the player character (of which btw, I simplified the camera controls, kindda moves like a plane in a shooter now):</p>
				<img src="mediojuan.gif" alt="Protagonist" style="width: 20em; height: 15em;">
				<p class="devEntry">I actually used the face of a friend of mine for the head's texture, but you can't really see it because the image was rendered at a low resolution, and even if you could, the texture is too low res to make up who it is anyways. <br>
				But it's still pretty cool. I kindda wanted to give him proper clothes, but since you're supposed to be underwater I thought I'd give him a scuba diver suit, which would make it easier for me to texture it :P<br><br>
				Anyways, that's about it for this devlog. Hope to see you soon with more changes!</p>
