# Blitz3D-Aquarium
A small project (that was originally made as an assignment for school) that I decided to turn into a sort-of 3D remake of Ascii Aquarium, written on Blitz3D.
Unless you disable the piece of code that disables texture filtering, you'll have to use this fix https://www.syntaxbomb.com/blitz2d-blitzplus-blitz3d/how-to-disable-bilinear-filtering-on-textures-blitz3d/ (the DLL that has to be included with the project is already included here, but you still have to add the userlibs files to your Blitz3D installation)
